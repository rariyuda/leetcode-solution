    "**Task:** Calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained from a sequence of stock prices.\n",

    "- The input consists of a list `prices` where each element represents the stock price on a given day.\n",
    "- The goal is to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling the stock.\n",

    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Use two variables: `candidate_buy` to keep track of the potential buying price and `max_profit` to store the maximum profit.\n",
    "- Iterate through the list of stock prices.\n",
    "  - If the current price is lower than the candidate buying price, update the candidate buying price to the current price.\n",

    "- The final value of `max_profit` represents the maximum profit achievable.\n",

    "**Pseudocode:**\n",
    "1. Initialize `candidate_buy` to positive infinity and `max_profit` to zero.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the list of stock prices.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code implements a solution to the problem of finding the maximum profit that can be obtained from a sequence of stock prices. The approach involves iterating through the list of prices while keeping track of the potential buying price (`candidate_buy`) and updating the maximum profit (`max_profit`) accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initialize `candidate_buy` to positive infinity. This variable represents the potential buying price, and starting with infinity ensures it gets updated with the first actual stock price.\n",
    "   - Initialize `max_profit` to zero. This variable tracks the maximum profit that can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration through Prices:**\n",
    "   - Iterate through the list of stock prices.\n",
    "   - If the current price is less than the current `candidate_buy`, update `candidate_buy` to the current price. This signifies a potential buying opportunity.\n",
    "   - If the difference between the current price and the `candidate_buy` is greater than the current `max_profit`, update `max_profit`. This ensures that the algorithm captures the maximum profit achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning Result:**\n",
    "   - The final value of `max_profit` represents the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling the stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "   - For instance, with `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`, the algorithm iterates through the prices.\n",
    "   - It identifies a potential buying opportunity at 1, and later, the maximum profit is achieved by buying at 1 and selling at 6, resulting in a profit of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation provides a clear and efficient solution to the problem of finding the maximum profit from a sequence of stock prices. The algorithm ensures that buying and selling decisions are made optimally to maximize the profit."
