The algorithm identifies a majority element (an element that appears more than ⌊n/2⌋ times, where n is the length of the array) in a single pass through the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm initializes two variables, `candidate` and `count`. `candidate` represents the current potential majority element, and `count` keeps track of its frequency.\n",

        "   candidate = None\n",
        "   count = 0\n",

        "\n",
        "    - If `count` is 0, it updates the `candidate` to the current element.\n",
        "    - If the current element is equal to the `candidate`, it increments `count`; otherwise, it decrements `count`.\n",

        "   for num in nums:\n",
        "       if count == 0:\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Count Maintenance**: The algorithm maintains a count of the majority element by incrementing or decrementing the count based on the equality of the current element and the candidate.\n",

It also uses O(1) space, making it an efficient and space-optimized solution for finding the majority element in an array. The provided code is clear, concise, and effectively addresses the problem."
