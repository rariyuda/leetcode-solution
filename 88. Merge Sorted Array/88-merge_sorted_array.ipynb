    "#### Discussion\n",
    "The method being used here is the \"Two-pointer merging\" technique. This approach involves having two pointers (in this case, x and y) iterating over two sorted arrays (nums1 and nums2), and merging them into a single sorted array (nums1).<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n",
    "- x and y are initialized to the last valid index in nums1 and nums2, respectively.\n",
    "- pos_id is initialized to the last index of the result array (nums1).\n",
    "- The while loop continues as long as there are elements remaining in nums2 (array y has not reached the beginning).\n",
    "- Inside the loop, it compares the current elements pointed to by x and y.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;- If the element in nums1 pointed to by x is greater than the element in nums2 pointed to by y, it places the element from nums1 at the pos_id index in nums1 and decrements x.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;- Otherwise, it places the element from nums2 at the pos_id index in nums1 and decrements y.<br>\n",
    "- The pos_id index is decremented in each iteration to fill the result array in reverse order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method efficiently merges two sorted arrays without using extra space, as it overwrites the elements in nums1 without requiring additional memory."
