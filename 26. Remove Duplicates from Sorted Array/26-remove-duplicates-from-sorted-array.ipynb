    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used in this code is often referred to as the \"Two-pointer sliding window\" technique. This method employs two pointers, `k` and `i`, to traverse and modify the array `nums` in-place. The primary goal is to remove duplicate elements by swapping and maintaining a distinct element count (`k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the logic breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**  `(k = 1)`: Initialize a variable `k` to 1. This variable will keep track of the length of the modified array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Iteration** `(for i in range(1, len(nums)))`: Iterate over the array `nums` starting from index 1. This loop is designed to compare each element with its previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison Check** `(if nums[i] != nums[i-1])`: Check if the current element at index `i` is not equal to the previous element at index `i-1`. This comparison identifies when a new distinct element is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Element Assignment** `(nums[k] = nums[i])`: If the condition in step 3 is true, assign the current element at index `i` to the position `k` in the array. This effectively moves distinct elements to the front of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incrementing k** `(k += 1)`: Increment the variable `k` to keep track of the length of the modified array.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Returning Length** `(return k)`: After the loop, return the final value of `k`, which represents the count of distinct elements in the array. The array itself is modified in place, with unique elements placed at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process efficiently removes duplicate elements from the array, eliminating duplicates while maintaining the order of unique elements in the array."
