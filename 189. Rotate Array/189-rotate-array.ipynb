    "Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n",

    "### Problem Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Rotate an integer array to the right by a given number of steps (`k`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input consists of an integer array `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`.\n",
    "- The goal is to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- We need to perform the rotation in-place without using any extra space.\n",
    "- Considerations: \n",
    "  - If `k` is greater than the length of the array, it's equivalent to rotating by `k % len(nums)` steps.\n",
    "  - The array is rotated to the right, so the last `k` elements will move to the front.\n",
    "- We can achieve the rotation by reversing specific portions of the array.\n",
    "  - Reverse the entire array.\n",
    "  - Reverse the first `k` elements.\n",
    "  - Reverse the remaining `len(nums) - k` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudocode:**\n",
    "1. Reverse the entire array.\n",
    "2. Reverse the first `k` elements.\n",
    "3. Reverse the remaining `len(nums) - k` elements."
