    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code provides a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem of determining the h-index of a researcher based on their array of citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sorting:**\n",
    "   - The citations array is first sorted in descending order. This is crucial because it allows us to easily identify the h-index during the iteration process. Sorting helps in quickly identifying papers with higher citation counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Search:**\n",
    "   - The code then goes through the sorted array, checking if the number of citations for a paper is greater than or equal to the potential h-index (represented by `h + 1`). If it is, the h-index is incremented. This process continues until a point where the condition is not met, indicating the maximum h-index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Return Result:**\n",
    "   - Finally, the function returns the determined h-index as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "   - Taking an example with `citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]`, after sorting, the array becomes `[6, 5, 3, 1, 0]`. The iteration finds that the researcher has at least `3` papers with `3` or more citations each, resulting in an h-index of `3`."
