    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code implements a concise and efficient solution to the problem of rotating an integer array `nums` to the right by a given number of steps `k`. The solution is performed in-place without utilizing any extra space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjustment for Large k:**\n",
    "   - The code first ensures that `k` is adjusted to be within the bounds of the array length by taking the modulus (`k %= len(nums)`). This is done to handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rotation Logic:**\n",
    "   - The array rotation is achieved by concatenating two sliced portions of the array.\n",
    "   - `nums[-k:]` represents the last `k` elements of the array.\n",
    "   - `nums[:-k]` represents the remaining elements excluding the last `k`.\n",
    "   - Concatenating these slices effectively places the last `k` elements at the front, achieving the desired rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In-Place Modification:**\n",
    "   - The use of `nums[:]` ensures that the original array is modified in place. The slicing and concatenation result in the updated array being assigned back to the original array reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "   - For instance, with `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, the adjusted `k` is 3.\n",
    "   - The concatenation `nums[-3:] + nums[:-3]` results in `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, achieving the required right rotation by 3 steps."
