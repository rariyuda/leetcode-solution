    "### Problem Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** Determine if it's possible to reach the last index of an array based on jump lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input consists of an array `nums` where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position.\n",
    "- The goal is to determine whether it's possible to reach the last index of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Initialize a variable `max_reach` to 0, representing the maximum reachable index.\n",
    "- Iterate through the array using a loop.\n",
    "  - For each index `i`, check if it is beyond the current `max_reach`. If so, return `false` as it's not possible to reach the last index.\n",
    "  - Update `max_reach` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`, representing the farthest index reachable from the current position.\n",
    "  - If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `true` as it is possible to reach the last index.\n",
    "- If the loop completes without returning, it means the last index is not reachable, so return `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudocode:**\n",
    "1. Initialize `max_reach` to 0.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the array using a loop with index `i`.\n",
    "   - If `i` is greater than `max_reach`, return `false`.\n",
    "   - Update `max_reach` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`.\n",
    "   - If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, return `true`.\n",
    "3. If the loop completes without returning, return `false` as the last index is not reachable."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code addresses the problem of determining whether it is possible to reach the last index of an array based on jump lengths. The algorithm employs a simple and efficient approach, iterating through the array while updating a variable, `max_reach`, which represents the farthest index reachable from the current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm initializes `max_reach` to 0, indicating the maximum reachable index.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Iteration through the Array:**\n",
    "   - The algorithm iterates through the array using a loop with an index variable `i`.\n",
    "   - For each index `i`, it checks if it is beyond the current `max_reach`. If so, the algorithm returns `False`, indicating it is not possible to reach the last index.\n",
    "   - It updates `max_reach` to the maximum of its current value and `i + nums[i]`, representing the farthest index reachable from the current position.\n",
    "   - If `max_reach` is greater than or equal to the last index, the algorithm returns `True`, indicating it is possible to reach the last index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning Result:**\n",
    "   - If the loop completes without returning, the algorithm returns `False` as the last index is not reachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "   - For example, with `nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`, the algorithm iterates through the array, updating `max_reach` based on the current index and jump length.\n",
    "   - It successfully determines that it is possible to reach the last index."
