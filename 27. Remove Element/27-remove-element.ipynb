    "The method employed in this code is known as the \"Two-pointer swapping\" technique. This approach utilizes two pointers, pos_left and pos_right, to iterate over the array nums. The objective is to remove occurrences of a specified value (val) by swapping elements without the need for additional space.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the logic:<br>\n",
    "- pos_left and pos_right are initialized to the start and end of the array nums, respectively.\n",
    "- The while loop continues as long as the left position (pos_left) is less than or equal to the right position (pos_right), ensuring proper traversal and comparison of array elements.\n",
    "- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current left position (pos_left) is equal to the target value val.\n",
    "    - If true, it swaps the element at pos_left with the element at pos_right and decrements pos_right.\n",
    "    - If false, it increments pos_left to move to the next element in the array.\n",
    "- The loop continues until the left and right positions meet, effectively handling the removal of occurrences of the target value by swapping elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method efficiently modifies the array in-place, removing specified values without requiring additional memory allocation."
