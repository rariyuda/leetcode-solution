    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start with initializing a variable `k` to 2, indicating the maximum allowed occurrences for each unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Processing:** Traverse the array `nums` from index 2 onwards.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Update Unique Elements:** If the check in step 3 is true, update the array by placing the current unique element at the `k`-th position. This step effectively builds a modified array with at most two occurrences of each unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Increment Counter (`k`):** Increment the counter `k` only if the condition in step 3 is true. This ensures that `k` is incremented only when a new distinct element is encountered, maintaining the correct length of the modified array.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Result:** The final value of `k` signifies the length of the modified array after eliminating duplicates, and the modified array retains the order of distinct elements."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above follows the \"Two-pointer sliding window\" technique to efficiently remove duplicate elements from the input array `nums`. This approach utilizes two pointers, `k` and `i`, for in-place array traversal and modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization** (`k = 2`): Start by initializing the variable `k` to 2. This variable acts as a counter, keeping track of the length of the modified array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loop Iteration** (`for i in range(2, len(nums))`): Iterate over the array `nums` starting from index 2. This loop helps to check each element against its previous one.\n",
    "3. **Comparison Check** (`if nums[i] != nums[k-2]`): Check if the current element at index `i` is distinct from the element two positions behind (at index `k-2`). This condition identifies when a new distinct element is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Element Assignment** (`nums[k] = nums[i]`): If the condition in step 3 is true, assign the current element at index `i` to the position `k` in the array. This effectively moves distinct elements to the front of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Incrementing `k`** (`k += 1`): Increment the variable `k` only if the condition in step 3 is true, indicating the presence of a distinct element. This ensures accurate tracking of the modified array length.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Returning Length** (`return k`): After the loop, return the final value of `k`, representing the count of distinct elements in the array. The array itself is modified in place, and only unique elements are retained at the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach efficiently handles the removal of duplicate elements, maintaining the order of unique elements in the modified array. The code provides a clear and concise solution to the problem."
